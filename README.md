- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Murat Al.
- I have spent my years in the academia and research labs, did engineering research and teaching on core mechanical engineering courses.
- I enjoyed learning and later teaching computer programming, adcanced math and statistics courses during my academic career. I have also added Data Science specific tools and Machine learning application trainings into my portfolio. This is a repository I have started to share some of my past works and upcoming projects with others. Some are the projects I  completed to get certified in IBM Data Scientist Program offered in Coursera.
- ðŸ‘€ Currently, Iâ€™m interested in Data Scientst,  Machine Learning engineering roles and keep working towards new projects on different  Data Science and ML/DL applications using different tools on various platforms.
